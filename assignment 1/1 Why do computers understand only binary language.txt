1. Why do computers understand only binary language?

ans. => 
        Computer is an electronic device ,
        it is collection of hardware devices such as RAM ,ROM , CPU, hard disk  etc.
        and they only understand electrical signals i.e.
        transition in the voltage .
        Modern based computers are based on semi conductor technology which understand high and low voltages.
        the CPU which consist of million of transistors they acts as switch ,
        at low voltage these acts as close switch 
        and at high voltage these acts as open switch  
        and open switch represents 1 and close represents as 0 .
        0 and 1 is called binary .
